### Day 1: December 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revised DSA notes, attempted 3 Medium lvl leet code questions, and studied DBMS.

**Thoughts:** This is the fist day of the challenge, I am quite motivated to start the challenge. Tried some Linked List questions, was able to solve them in very less time. Feeling confident because I touched the DSA after so long and was able to solve these questions quite easily.
